Description:

MediMatch is a streamlined Healthcare Management System, focused on improving how patients connect with healthcare providers. This system will not only allow users to book appointments but will cater to diverse needs by considering the userâ€™s specialization preferences. In addition, this system will simplify the appointment process and improve communication and comfort by matching patients with culturally and linguistically compatible doctors while making healthcare more personalized and accessible. MediMatch is an inclusive environment in that there are more opportunities for patients to connect with a diverse group of healthcare professionals. Users will not only have access to various providers to choose from based on their preferences, but also have the ability to receive notifications directly from their chosen providers regarding updates on their scheduled appointments. Additionally, users will have the ability to give feedback on specific providers through a feedback system. This will allow providers to have a better understanding of their service and thus more positive feedback will allow providers to gain popularity which allows them to have the opportunity to gain more patients.
